# Nice Return Visits Localization Policy

This document defines the localization strategy and requirements for Nice Return Visits across the website and app repositories.

---

## Core Branding Rules

The following identifiers are **global brand elements** and must **remain unchanged in every language and writing system**:

- **NRV** — the abbreviation for the app and for a single Nice Return Visit
- **Nice Return Visits** — the full branded name of the app
- **RV** — the branded abbreviation for "Return Visit" when used as a noun in context (e.g., "Never forget an RV.")

### Tagline Translation

Translate the surrounding tagline naturally, but retain **RV** exactly as **RV**. The current approved examples are:

- **English:** NRV - Nice Return Visits / *Never forget an RV.*
- **Spanish:** NRV - Nice Return Visits / *Nunca olvides un RV.*

Future languages, including languages using non-Latin scripts, must follow the same branding rule: keep the brand name and RV unchanged, translate the tagline naturally.

---

## Website Language Architecture

### Language-Specific Routes

The website uses a single-language-per-path architecture:

- **English (default):** Root level (e.g., `index.html`, `help.html`, `getting-started.html`)
- **Spanish:** `es/` folder (e.g., `es/index.html`, `es/help.html`, `es/getting-started.html`)

Each language version maintains its own HTML pages with identical structure and shared CSS/JS.

**Pages included in both languages:**
- `index.html` — Home page
- `getting-started.html` — Installation and setup guidance
- `help.html` — In-app documentation and support
- `faq.html` — Frequently asked questions
- `contact.html` — Contact and support
- `privacy.html` — Privacy notice
- `terms.html` — Terms of use

### Language Selection

The website provides a language menu in the header:

- **Visible as:** "Language" dropdown in the header (top right)
- **Mechanics:** HTML `<details>` element with clickable language links
- **No persistence:** The language menu navigates to a different URL path; each path maintains its language independently
- **Script:** `assets/js/language-menu.js` — Handles dropdown open/close behavior only

Users select a language by clicking a link; there is no automatic language detection.

---

## Website-to-App Language Handoff

When a user clicks the "Open NRV" button on the website, they are directed to the app at `https://grasfulls.github.io/nice-return-visits-app/` (the same URL from both English and Spanish pages).

**Current behavior:** The website does not currently pass a language parameter to the app. When the app launches, it:
1. First checks for a valid `?lang=<code>` URL parameter (if present)
2. Then checks for a previously stored language preference in browser `localStorage`
3. Falls back to English if neither is available

If a language parameter is provided in the URL, the app will use that language and save it to local storage for subsequent visits.

**Future enhancement:** The website may be updated to pass `?lang=en` or `?lang=es` parameters to the app launch URLs, ensuring that users who arrive from the Spanish website will launch the app in Spanish, and that preference will persist on return visits.

---

## Language Persistence in the App

The app uses a runtime i18n system (`i18n.js`) that:

1. **On first launch:** Checks for a `?lang=<code>` URL parameter; if present and valid, uses that language
2. **On return launches:** Restores the user's previously selected language from browser `localStorage`
3. **Fallback:** Defaults to English if no language preference is found or the stored preference is unavailable
4. **Language is persisted** in the browser's local storage on the device and survives installation as a Home Screen app

The app does not provide an in-app language selector. To change the app's language after initial setup, users must:
- Reinstall the app from the desired language's website page (if the website is updated to pass `?lang=` parameters in the future)
- Clear browser data and revisit the app URL with an explicit `?lang=<code>` parameter

### Home Screen Apps (Installed PWA)

When NRV is installed as a Home Screen app (PWA):

- Each installed copy maintains its own language preference in its own browser storage
- Installing NRV in Browser A with Spanish selected does NOT affect Browser B or other devices
- The Home Screen copy and the browser copy are independent and may have different languages
- Changing language requires clearing data and reinstalling, or accessing the app with an explicit `?lang=` parameter

---

## Language Independence from Contact Location

**Critical rule:** The app's interface language and the contact database country/location are **completely independent**.

- A user with a Spanish interface can manage contacts in any country
- A user with an English interface can manage Spanish contacts and addresses
- Contact address country, contact phone number format, and interface language are three separate concerns
- Do not infer or assume a user's contact location based on their interface language
- Do not restrict address fields based on the interface language

---

## User-Facing Content (Translatable)

The following content is user-facing and translatable:

### Website

- Page titles (`<title>`, `<h1>`, etc.)
- Headings and body copy (marketing, help, legal)
- Navigation labels ("Home", "Getting Started", "Help", "FAQ", "Contact")
- Button text ("Open NRV", "Getting Started")
- Form labels and help text
- Footer text

### App

- All UI text: labels, buttons, menu items, prompts, error messages, help text
- Page titles and section headings
- Form fields and validation messages
- Dialog text and confirmations
- Settings labels and descriptions
- Localized using `data-i18n="key"` attributes and the `locales/<code>.json` catalog files
- Translations managed via the `i18n.js` runtime and `NRVI18n.t()` function

---

## Non-Translatable Content

The following must **never** be translated:

### Brand Identifiers

- **NRV** — the app name and abbreviation
- **Nice Return Visits** — the full brand name
- **RV** — when used as the branded abbreviation for Return Visit

### Internal/Canonical Values

- Database field names and schema identifiers (e.g., `firstName`, `lastName`, `contactId`)
- Code identifiers and variable names
- URLs and file paths
- Email addresses and domain names
- Configuration keys and enum values
- API parameter names and response keys

### Data Values

- Contact names and personal information (user data)
- User-entered notes and addresses
- Email addresses and phone numbers
- Custom City, Region, and Area names created by the user
- Date and time values (use locale-aware formatting, not translation)

### Legal/Copyright

- Copyright notices and license text (English version is canonical; translations may be provided separately if legally appropriate)

---

## International Address Requirements

The app's address model is country-aware and includes country-specific address field labels and formatting:

### Supported Countries

Current supported countries (expandable):
- **Canada**
- **Mexico**
- **Peru**
- **United States** (default)

Each contact has an optional `country` field; if not specified, the contact uses the user's default country setting (configured in Settings).

### Country-Specific Address Field Labels

The app dynamically updates address field labels based on the selected country:

- **Peru:** Uses administrative terms
  - State → Department
  - City → Locality
  - Region → Province
  - Area → District
  
- **Other countries (Canada, Mexico, United States):** Use standard terms
  - State (province in Canada)
  - City
  - Region
  - Area

### Address Fields (Language and Country Independent)

All contacts support:
- Street address (free-form text, any language)
- State/Department/Province (country-specific term, user-entered)
- City/Locality (user-entered, displayed in custom City list)
- Region (user-entered, displayed in custom Region list)
- Area (user-entered, displayed in custom Area list)
- Postal code (optional)
- Country (dropdown, defaults to user's setting)
- Map coordinates (latitude/longitude, user can place or adjust pins)

### Key Architectural Principle

**Contact address country, interface language, and user settings are completely independent systems.**

- A user with a Spanish interface can manage contacts in any supported country
- A user with an English interface can manage Spanish/Mexico/Peru addresses
- Changing the interface language does not affect existing contact data
- Do not infer or assume a user's contact location based on their interface language
- Do not restrict address fields based on interface language

### Adding Country Support

When adding a new country to NRV:

**Adding a new language must not require modifying the address data model.** Interface language and address country are independent systems. New country support may require country-specific field labels, ordering, formatting, validation, or presentation rules, but these should use the common country-neutral address model wherever possible.

A flexible international address model should be reviewed and designed before additional country-specific address schemes are added. The goal is to support multiple countries without requiring schema changes for each new language or region added.

## Requirements for Adding a New Language

To add a language to either the website or the app, follow these steps:

### For the Website

1. **Create translated HTML pages** in a new language folder (e.g., `fr/` for French):
   - Copy all HTML files from the root to the new folder
   - Translate all user-facing content in each page
   - Keep the brand names unchanged: **NRV**, **Nice Return Visits**, **RV**
   - Update navigation links to point to the same-language versions
   - Keep the tagline translation natural

2. **Update the language menu** in all existing pages (English and other languages):
   - Add a new `<li>` entry for the new language
   - Ensure the link points to the correct path in the new language folder
   - Test the language menu in all pages and all languages

3. **Verify responsive design** at phone (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1200px) widths

4. **Update `README.md`** with the new language and folder structure

### For the App

1. **Create a locale file** `locales/<code>.json`:
   - Copy `locales/en.json` as a template
   - Translate all values (keys remain unchanged)
   - Keep brand identifiers and internal values unchanged
   - Use proper plural forms if required by the language

2. **Register the language** in `i18n.js`:
   - Add an entry to the `LANGUAGES` array
   - Specify the language code, display name, and file path
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     { code: "fr", name: "Français", file: "locales/fr.json" }
     ```

3. **Run automated tests**:
   - `node tests/i18n-check.js` — Validates the locale file structure and completeness

4. **(Optional, future enhancement) Update the website** to link to the app with the new language parameter:
   - When the website is updated to pass `?lang=<code>` to app URLs, add links like: `https://grasfulls.github.io/nice-return-visits-app/?lang=fr`

5. **Test the language in the app:**
   - Launch the app and verify all text displays correctly in the new language
   - Test across all app pages and features
   - Verify date/time formatting (use locale-aware `Intl.*` APIs, not translation)
   - Test on multiple browsers and devices
   - Test at common viewport widths (phone, tablet, desktop)

6. **Test language persistence:**
   - Launch the app in the new language (either via `?lang=<code>` parameter or by manually changing the browser's locale)
   - Close and reopen the app; verify the language is remembered
   - Install as a Home Screen app; verify language preference persists

7. **Update documentation:**
   - Add the new language to the app's `README.md` and the website's `README.md`
   - Note any language-specific limitations or considerations

## Documentation and PDF Localization

### Website Documentation

- The **Getting Started**, **Help**, and **FAQ** pages are website content and should be translated as part of adding a new language
- These pages are the public documentation; they are separate from the in-app help

### In-App Help

- The app's in-app `help.html` is localized via the same i18n system:
  - Headings and sections use `data-i18n` attributes
  - Long-form text content (like help instructions) uses plain HTML with manual translation
  - The `help.html` file is version-controlled in the app repository

### PDF Guides and Downloads

- Downloadable user guides (e.g., `NRV-Setup-User-Guide.pdf`) may be provided in multiple languages
- Each language version is stored separately and linked from the appropriate website pages
- PDF localization is outside the scope of this document; coordinate with documentation maintainers

---

- [ ] Website-to-app handoff works (if applicable)
- [ ] Backup/restore works with contacts created in different languages
- [ ] User can switch languages without losing data (website and app independently)

---

## Repository Coordination

### Website Repository (`nice-return-visits-site`)

- **Language routes:** English (root), Spanish (`es/`)
- **Shared assets:** `assets/css/styles.css`, `assets/js/language-menu.js`, images
- **Language-specific pages:** HTML files in root and `es/` folder
- **LOCALIZATION.md:** This file (policy document, identical in both repositories)

### App Repository (`nice-return-visits-app`)

- **Language system:** i18n.js runtime with localStorage persistence
- **Locale files:** `locales/<code>.json`
- **Supported languages:** Registered in `i18n.js` LANGUAGES array
- **In-app selector:** Settings → Language
- **Tests:** `node tests/i18n-check.js` validates locale completeness
- **LOCALIZATION.md:** Copy of the policy (with optional App Implementation Notes section if needed)

### Policy Synchronization

The **core localization policy** in `LOCALIZATION.md` must remain identical in both repositories. This document defines:

- Core branding rules
- Language architecture (website paths, app i18n system)
- What is translatable vs. non-translatable
- Requirements for adding a new language
- Testing requirements

Repository-specific technical details (e.g., "Use `i18n.js`" for the app, "Use HTML files in `es/` folder" for the website) are included in the relevant sections and are not duplicated.

If a repository-specific technical clarification is needed, add it in a clearly labeled **App Implementation Notes** or **Website Implementation Notes** section rather than altering the shared policy.

---

## Maintenance Workflow

When changes are made to user-facing content:

1. **Update the English version** first (website or app)
2. **Update all other language versions** immediately after
3. **Test each language** to ensure translations are accurate and display correctly
4. **Commit and push** all language versions together
5. **Document the change** if it affects the localization policy or adds a new language

When the language policy itself changes:

1. **Update LOCALIZATION.md** in the website repository
2. **Copy the updated file** to the app repository
3. **Ensure the core policy remains identical** in both repositories
4. **Note any repository-specific implementation details** in separate sections, not in the core policy
5. **Commit and push** the updates to both repositories in separate, coordinated commits
